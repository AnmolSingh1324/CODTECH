# 🧠 AI Generative Text Model

An interactive web-based LSTM & GPT-inspired text generation platform built with TensorFlow.js and JavaScript. Users can train a model on various topics and generate coherent, creative paragraphs using an intuitive UI and customizable parameters.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Live model training in the browser using TensorFlow.js
- 📝 Generate creative text outputs based on different topics
- 📊 Real-time training metrics: vocabulary size, loss, parameters, etc.
- 🎨 Beautiful responsive UI with animated design and glassmorphism
- 🔧 Adjustable text length, temperature, and prompts

## 🛠️ Built With

- **TensorFlow.js** – Neural network training and inference
- **JavaScript** – Tokenization, logic, and control flow
- **HTML & CSS** – Stylish interface with animations and modern UI

## 📚 Topics Supported

- Technology & Innovation
- Science & Discovery
- Travel & Adventure
- Food & Cuisine
- Nature & Environment
- History & Culture


## 🔧 How to Use

1. Open `GenerativeTextModel.html` in any modern browser.
2. Select a topic or enter a custom prompt.
3. Click **"Initialize & Train Model"** to train the LSTM.
4. Adjust creativity and length as needed.
5. Click **"Generate Text"** to see your AI-generated paragraph.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `GenerativeTextModel.html`: All-in-one HTML, CSS, and JS implementation

## ✅ TODO / Future Improvements

- Add real GPT model integration (e.g., via API)
- Enable persistent training data storage
- Improve coherence with attention-based decoding
- Add downloadable/exportable generated content
